# Music-Box-Audio-Visualization

Music Box Audio Visualization, made mainly using P5.js, shows a music box in the middle of the application, and produces particle notes when music is played. The music box vibrates according to the bass and the particles are created according to the treble. The GUI controls enable users to adjust the visuals of the extension.
